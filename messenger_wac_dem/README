This directory contains the scripts used to create a WAC only DEM from all
MESSENGER orbital images. The first isisminer run is with the
mdis_image_overlaps.conf CONFIG file. It reads from an SQLite database
that is not generally available, but can (and was) created using output
from the caminfo application. The output of this is a 10x10 region based
set of CSV files of image overlap information. These files are then input
into the next isisminer run of mdis_wac_matcher.conf.  After all these
files have been run, here is the list of the general steps to create a DEM:


1) Run all EW*_overlap.csv files in /scratch/kbecker/MESSENGER/Control/Overlaps
   (i.e., find /scratch/kbecker/MESSENGER/Control/Overlaps -name 'EW*_overlaps.csv')
   with mdis_wac_matcher.conf to create image-based control networks (from 118,267
   WAC image overlap sets).
2) Combine all these image-based files into a single global control network
   using cnetcombinept.
3) Run cnetcheck of the global network to identify issues.
4) Run jigsaw to control images (will likely take a few days without error
   propagation).
5) Run cnet2dem to create interpolated DEM.
6) Run series of noise and smoothing filters on DEM from previous step.
7) Run ckwriter on the updated images to generate CK kernel.

Note, the control network is likely to be ginormous. You may need up to 512GB
of memory to complete these steps.  Also, use of a compute cluster is highly
recommended!

-------------

To create a PDS table of the control point cloud, you can use the CONFIG
jigsaw_bundleout_sigmas_pdsfmt.conf. This requires the bundleout points file
created by jigsaw that *MUST* have error propagation turned on (without error
propagation, the format of the outfile is missing columns which will result
in very bad things!).  The config file shows how POINTCLOUDTAB.FMT is created
but is disabled (by adding "_DNE" to the Strategy Object keyword) - this can
be time consuming.  Here is the command used to create the MESSENGER PDS
pointcloud table:

isisminer config=$ISIS3DATA/base/templates/isisminer/jigsaw_bundleout_sigmas_pdsfmt.conf \
          parameters="bundleout:RadAngTwist_global_jigsaw_errorprop_bundleout_points.csv \
          @tofmt:$ISIS3DATA/base/templates/isisminer/POINTCLOUDTAB.FMT@totab:MSGR_DEM_USG_EQ_C_V01.TAB"
